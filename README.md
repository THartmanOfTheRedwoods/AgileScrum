# Stories, epics, and initiatives

Imagine you and your team aspire to undertake a challenging project, such as launching a rocket into space. To achieve this, it's crucial to organize your work meticulously, from overarching goals to the smallest details. The ability to adapt to change, track progress, and adhere to a plan becomes essential. In this context, an manager can leverage tools like stories, epics, and initiatives.

By grasping how these widely used agile and DevOps methodologies aid in structuring work, the manager can guide their developers to strike a harmonious balance between organization, flexibility, and achieving ambitious objectives like launching rockets into space.

## So, what exactly are stories, epics, and initiatives?

* **Stories**, also known as "user stories," are concise requirements or requests framed from an end user's perspective.
* **Epics** represent substantial bodies of work that can be deconstructed into smaller tasks, referred to as stories.
* **Initiatives** are clusters of epics designed to work collectively towards a common objective.

An analogy can be drawn between stories and epics in the agile process and their counterparts in film or literature. In this comparison, a story corresponds to a simple narrative, while an epic comprises a series of interconnected stories. Similarly, in work management, completing related stories contributes to the fulfillment of an epic. Stories convey the narrative of completed tasks, while epics provide a high-level overview of the overarching goal.

On an agile team, stories are commitments that the team aims to complete within a two-week sprint. Developers often work on numerous stories each month. In contrast, epics are fewer in number and take a longer time to finish, with teams typically focusing on two or three epics per quarter.

For instance, if the manager's objective is to enhance a streaming service for rocket launches, they might structure their stories like the following examples:

### Examples of an agile story

* As an iPhone user, I want to see a vertical view of the live feed when using the mobile app, so I get the best perspective on the retina display.
* As a desktop user, I want to see a "view fullscreen" button in the lower right-hand corner of the video player, so I can get a wide/full perspective of the launch.
* As an Android user, I want to be linked to the Apple store, so that I can purchase live stream channels from the Apple store.

These stories, interconnected and task-oriented, contribute to the completion of a larger body of workâ€”an epic. The overarching goal, in this case, could be "Improve Streaming Service for Q1 Launch."

Organizing work into stories and epics facilitates effective communication within the organizational context. When reporting progress to the leadership, the manager can focus on epics. In discussions with colleagues on the development team, communication can happen at the story level.

## Agile epic vs. initiative

Just as epics consist of stories, initiatives encompass epics. Initiatives offer a higher level of organization, compiling epics from multiple teams to achieve broader and more significant goals. While an epic may be completed in a month or a quarter, initiatives often span multiple quarters to a year.

### Example of epics in an initiative:

Consider a scenario where the manager's goal is to decrease the cost per rocket launch by 5% within a year. This ambitious objective is suitable for an initiative, which may include epics such as reducing launch-phase fuel consumption, increasing launches per quarter, and implementing specific operational changes.

At the instructional level, initiatives can be compared to overarching goals, and epics can be likened to more detailed objectives. This hierarchical structuring aids in comprehending and managing complex projects. For example, the manager may use terms like "annual goals" for initiatives and "activities" for epics.

In summary, just as stories and epics are vital in agile methodologies, initiatives provide a strategic framework for achieving substantial goals. By employing these organizational tools, the manager can guide developers in navigating complex projects and striking a balance between structure, adaptability, and achieving ambitious objectives.

## Student Project Focus

Since we are only working on our projects for a 16 week semester, we will only be focusing on Epics, User-Stories, and Sub-Tasks for those stories.
